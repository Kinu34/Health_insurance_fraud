# Health_insurance_fraud
I.	Introduction
       1.1 Project Title: Fraud detection analysis on Health Insurance Data using Data analytics.
       1.2 Project Overview: Health insurance fraud is a major issue, which leads to significant financial losses to the insurance companies, governments and tax payers. Type of fraud include duplicate claims, misrepresented medical services, false patient records, overcharging on the medical claims, etc. 
The goal of this project is to analyze the real-world datasets using SQL and Python libraries to identify the fraudulent claims. These flagged claims can be reviewed by a human before payments are processed. While many companies have adopted machine learning algorithms to address these issues, this project does not incorporate machine learning.
Instead, the project focuses on utilizing data acquisition, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis techniques, rule-based fraud detection and visualization. The goal is to ensure that the project can be readily applied in real world scenarios to solve this growing problem.

II.	Project Scope and Objectives
2.1	Scope: The project includes following steps:
•	Data Acquisition: Identify and acquire the publicly available datasets that are relevant for the project.
•	Data Storage: Utilize an SQL database (SQLite) for data management.
•	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Perform data cleansing task such as handling missing values, removing duplicate, and standardizing data formats using Pandas.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify fraud indicators and analyze data to detect claim trends. 
•	Fraud Detections: Develop rule-based methods using SQL and Pandas to uncover anomalies and fraud patterns.
•	Visualizations: Develop Dashboards using Tableau and libraries like matplotlib/seaborn for getting greater insight in data through visualizations.
•	Documentation: Prepare a README file, SQL scripts, Python notebook, and final documentation for the project.

2.2	Objective: Following are objectives for this project:
•	Analyze data and identify patterns that indicates fraudulent health insurance claims.
•	Use SQL and Pandas for data manipulation and fraud detection.
•	Present the insights visually through dashboards.
•	Develop a rule-based system for fraud detection.

III.	Technical Requirements
3.1	Tools & Technologies:
•	Programming Language & libraries: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
•	Database: SQLite
•	Visualizations: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
•	Documentation Version Control: Github and Jupyter Notebook

3.2	Data Source:
•	Healthcare provider fraud detection analysis: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis)


IV.	Implementation Stages:
4.1	Phase 1: Data Acquisition & Storage: 
•	Data Download
•	Load the data into Pandas
•	Store Data in an SQLite Database

4.2	Phase 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
•	Perform Data Cleaning Operations such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, filtering out irrelevant fields.
•	Normalize the data to maintain data consistency.
•	Validate the data to ensure completeness and accuracy.

4.3	Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Calculate Summary Statistics like mean, median, mode, standard deviation and other descriptive statistics.
•	Distribution Analysis: Visualize the claim amounts and other important key attributes.
•	Trend Analysis: Identify the hidden trends in the fraud related cases.
•	Correlation: Identify relation between two or more attributes in the data to uncover hidden insights.




4.4	Phase 4: Fraud Detection & Anomaly Identification:
•	Use SQL and Pandas to identify the fraudulent transactions and patterns.

4.5	Phase 5: Visualization & Dashboard:
•	Matplotlib/Seaborn: Create charts and plots to effectively present findings.
•	Tableau Dashboards: Develop an interactive dashboard to summarize the insights.

4.6	Phase 6: Finalize Documentation & Outputs:
•	Github Repository: Store all scripts, datasets, and notebooks.
•	README File: Document the project structure, methodology and final results.
•	Jupyter Notebook: Consolidate Python scripts, SQL queries, EDA and fraud detection analysis.
•	Final Presentation: Summarize key findings, fraud detection methodologies, and recommendations for fraud mitigations.


V.	Expected Output
•	Identify the fraudulent transactions in the data and present them in a visually appealing dashboard.
•	Provide suggestion on mitigating fraud risk based on the facts from the data.
